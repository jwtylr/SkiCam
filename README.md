## About
This is an online tool that hosts resort livestreams alongside traffic cameras around Northern Vermont ski resorts. Developed by Jack Taylor at the University of Vermont. I aim to have most popular resorts webcams and traffic cameras hosted here, alongside weather reports and conditions updates. This is an ongoing personal project with no timeline.

The project is hosted on UVM's Silk Servers using university credentials.

The Github repo does not contain scripts that access api's.

## Features
- Available resort webcams for various ski resorts
- Auto-refreshing traffic camera views of nearby access roads
- Weather conditions including:
    - Temperature
    - Apparent temperature
    - Wind speed & direction
